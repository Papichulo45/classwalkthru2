## Guide: How to Use This Repo

1. Look at the top right corner below the top bar. Click the **Fork** button.

2. Now you have your own copy (fork) of my repository to play with.

3. Click on the green **Clone or download** button and then on the copy icon, to copy the URL of your copy of the repository.

4. In PyCharm: 

    a. If you have projects open:
    
      1. Click on **VCS** and then select **Checkout from Version Control** and then select **Git**.
    
      2. In the window that pops up, paste the URL you copied.
    
      3. Click **Test**. Should work.
    
      4. Click **Clone** and continue with opening the project.
    
    b. If you don't have any projects open and you only see the initial PyCharm box with options to Create a New Project, Open, or Checkout from Version Control:
    
      1. Click **Checkout from Version Control** and then select **Git**.
    
      2. In the window that pops up, paste the URL you copied.
    
      3. Click **Test**. Should work.
    
      4. Click **Clone** and continue with opening the project.

5. Now you have the code that I wrote in your own development environment. This is the power of using Github.
